This style guide outlines the formatting conventions to be followed in all documentation files.

### Section 1: Header Formatting

* Use header titles (H1-H6) to organize content.
* Use blank lines between sections.

### Section 2: Code Blocks

* Use triple backticks (````) to delimit code blocks.
* Indent code within the block with four spaces for each level of nesting.

### Section 3: List Formatting

* Use numbered or bullet lists as needed.
* Keep list items concise and focused on one idea.

### Section 4: Hyperlinks

* Use relative links (e.g., `./file.md`) instead of absolute ones.
* Provide a brief description for each link.
