## Yet Another Geometric Calculations Library

This project produces easy to use functions for use in different fields of mathematics. In particular, for algebra, geometry, and calculus. Additionally, for analysis, combinatorics, and probability.

This is a software library for performing mathematical calculations and manipulations in mostly geometric and calculus contexts. The project provides classes and functions for mathematical tasks.

**Goals:**

1. A good study project. I am a high school math teacher, who is currently studying computer science in higher ed.
2. Provide an accurate and efficient way to perform mathematical calculations in geometric contexts.
3. Offer a reusable software library for developers working on projects involving geometry, algebra, or calculus.
4. Provide a different approach and interface than mathlib or numpy, and avoid importing prebuilt functions.
5. Where possible, have each class and function be a simple application of a well understood mathematical result.

**Use Cases:**

1. Students and teachers who want good demonstrations and working applications of problems in the math curriculum.
2. Engineers, architects, researchers, or designers who need to calculate distances, angles, derivatives, integrals, progressions, etc.
3. Software developers building applications that require mathematical computations, such as:
	* Scientific simulations
	* Graphics rendering engines
	* Mathematical model visualization tools

**Target Audience**

The target audience for this project is anyone who needs to perform mathematical calculations, such as students, researchers, engineers, or developers. The code is designed to be easy to understand and use, without requiring dependencies.
Overall, this project provides a practical collection of mathematical functions and classes that can be used in various contexts, from educational purposes to real-world applications, and is easy to reuse.
